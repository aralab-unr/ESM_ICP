## Features

- Implementation of the ESM-ICP algorithm for precise point cloud registration.
- Visualization tools for analyzing registration results.
- Modular code structure for easy integration and extension.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler
- [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) library
- [PCL (Point Cloud Library)](https://pointclouds.org/) (optional, for visualization)

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
